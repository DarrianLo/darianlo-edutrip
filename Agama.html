                <h3>This is the Agama page</h3>
                <p>So for the Agama homework i got while on my Jogjakarta Edutrip was to note my visit to the churches and answer the questions given.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What Is Unique in the church i went to? There was a well containing holy water</li>
                    <li>Explain the history of the church i went to! The place was built so the community around could have a place to worship God</li>
                    <li>What is the difference between the church i went to and the church nearby Saint Laurensia School? There was a well with holy water and we could take as much as we needed</li>
                </ul>

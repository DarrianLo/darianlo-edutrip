                <p>So for the Bahasa Indonesia homework i got while on the Jogjakarta edutrip was that i had to review a hotel.
                    The Hotel that i have decided to review is Hotel Grand Mercure Jogjakarta. So the hotel is a 5 star rating hotel. There were 503 rooms, you could order foods in the room by using the telephone provided. There were so much fasilities such as a tv, kettle, bottle, telephone. There was also an airport nearby which can be a great help if you're going to fly somewhere. The hotel also had a restaurant. The restaurant had a lot of food variaties such as heavy food, light food, and dessert. The food tasted amazing they were warm and carefully prepaired.
